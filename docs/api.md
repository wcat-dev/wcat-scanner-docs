The core API gateway for WCAT-Scanner lite.

## Getting Started

1. `docker-compose up`

## API

You can use WCAT-Scanner either using REST, [graphQL](https://wcat.dev/playground), or gRPC. At the moment the gRPC API is exposed with limits to consumers.
View the [API endpoints available](https://wcat.dev/api-info) to get detailed examples with curl snippets.

## ENV Configuration

If your running WCAT-Scanner on your own machine, some configs you may want to add consist of the following:

```sh
# everything unlocked for all users!
SUPER_MODE=true
DB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017/?compressors=zlib&gssapiServiceName=mongodb
DB_NAME=wcat
# website front-end client allowed domains
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000,http://0.0.0.0
GRAPHQL_PORT=3280
# email configs

EMAIL_CLIENT_ID=
EMAIL_SERVICE_PASSWORD=

```

## Account Upgrade Programmatically

You can upgrade an account and build ontop of the infrastructure by using the following endpoints.

1. POST `/api/register` or `/api/login`.
1. GET `/api/client-key` - get the stripe client token.
1. Use key with [stripe.js](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js) to get access to subscriptions.
1. GET `/api/plans` - display the plans and use with a UI to select options or programmatically use one by using the `title` property as `plan` on the next step.
1. POST `/api/upgrade` with body containing `stripeToken`, `plan`(title key from step 4), and `yearly` properties to determine if the yearly plan was selected with valid user authenticated in `header` or cookies enabled.

In order to cancel a subscription use `/api/cancel-subscription` with a valid user authenticated. 
You can upgrade and downgrade an account at any time using the endpoint between all plans with proration.
