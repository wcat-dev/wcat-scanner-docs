View micro-service details on purpose and port entry below.

All of the services use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) to communicate except the primary API allows REST, Graphql, and gRPC entrypoints.

The only service that is exposed outside to connections is the `web` service which is the front-end application and the central gateway `api` in production. Use the [central repo](https://github.com/WCAT-Scanner/wcat) in order to run all of the services together through docker or the [sidecar](https://github.com/A11yWatch/sidecar).
